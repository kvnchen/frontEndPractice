SVG

An XML markup language for vector graphics.
Similar to XML and HTML in that SVGs are documents wrapped in <svg> tags containing tags that describe how to draw an image.

With rendering, later elements are generally rendered on top of previous ones.

Without specifying specific units (px, cm), one user unit (represented by plain numbers without identifiers) equals one screen unit.

The mapping of user units to screen units is called the user coordinate system.
The default user coordinate system maps one user pixel to one device pixel.

The coordinate system for SVGs treat the top left corner of the screen as (0,0), where positive x denotes distance to the right of the origin, and positive y denotes distance to the bottom from the origin.
This is the same coordinate system used in HTML.

x and y attributes on shape elements denote where the top left corner of the shape is from the origin.


Paths

The <path> element can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more. It is the most powerful element in the SVG library.

The shape of a <path> element is defined by one parameter: d
The d attribute contains a series of commands and parameters used by those commands.

Commands are instantiated by a specific letter.
The "Move to" command uses the letter M
To move to (10,10), the command would be M 10 10

All commands come in two variants. An uppercase letter specifies absolute coordinates on the page, and a lowercase letter specifies relative coordinates (e.g. move 10px up and 7px to the left from the last point).

Coordinates in the d parameter are always unitless and hence in the user coordinate system.


Simple shapes can be more easily drawn using polygon or polyline, but there's no performance penalty or bonus for using paths instead.
